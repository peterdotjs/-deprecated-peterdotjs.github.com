#### There are plenty of guides on how to develop a Chrome extension - this won't be another one of them. I'll be going through my personal experience and lessons learned through each step of the process. These learnings can be applied to any type of application development - not just Chrome extensions.

## [Part 1: Inception - the idea, requirements, design][1]
## Part 2: Development - apis, tracking
## Part 3: Testing - cross platform
## Part 4: Production - deployment, artwork, user feedback
## Part 5: Maintenance - enhancements, bug fixes, updates
