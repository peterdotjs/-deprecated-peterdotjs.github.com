  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The idea</h2>

<p>You should definitely read Paul Graham&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" title="start up ideas">startup ideas</a> if you haven&#8217;t yet already. Most products come out of an  existing problem. This problem may be unoticed, compensated for or perhaps very difficult to solve. Workarounds exist everywhere in our daily lives and if you could find one to make more efficient then you likely have a product on your hands.</p>

<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve brain stormed several ideas, now it&#8217;s time to face the music and search for similar solutions. Although it might be hearbreaking to find that someone else had come up with that same awesome idea that you had - it&#8217;s not at all the end of the world. In fact it might even help you. If you research your competitors you can find all their pain points, user feedback, and areas where you can improve upon. I&#8217;ve seen many extensions that were great ideas to begin with but simply weren&#8217;t executed well. Either it be the user experience, the design or bugs in the product, these are all areas where you could improve upon. However, if there are already several great and solid products out there you should probably consider contributing to one of them rather than creating your own. The world may not need another adblock tool or responsive web tester.</p>

<h3>[Tab Resize]</h3>

<p>I found myself manually resizing windows across my monitor and realized just how inefficient that workflow was. I compensated by doing it by hand but I figured that there had to be some kind of extension to do this for me. I did a search on the Chrome Web store and found several that were in the ballpark of what I was looking for (&#8220;Split Screen&#8221;, &#8220;Tab Scissors&#8221;, &#8220;Dualless&#8221;, etc.) These extensions each do something different but each had their own respective limitations. Once I realized that there was room in the market for a split screen layout extension, I knew it was worth building. At this point the idea of having users didn&#8217;t cross my mind.  I figured at the very least I&#8217;d be able to use it and make my own life a little easier.</p>

<h2>Requirements and Design</h2>

<p>In both school and in industry there is somone telling you what do to; a professor and program manager respectively that will describe in detail the requirements of the project that you are venturing on. In addition, the design (both technology and visual) are also determined for you (usually). With a project that is completely of your own, you may find youself overwhelmed with the amount of freedom and number of choice you now have. Requirements can be shaped by the problem you want to solve in addition to the areas that your competitors are lacking in. Choosing a visual design and color scheme is kind of like choosing a parking spot in a very sparse parking lot - you&#8217;ll have a lot of choices and it might take some time to decide which one to use.</p>

<p>Try to pay as much attention to the user experience if not more than the actual features. Having amazing features that are difficult to use or discover will produce poor results. It goes without saying that the features the application is providing must be flawless or close to being bug free. However great the visual user experience is, it can never compensate for poor execution in function.</p>

<h3>[Tab Resize]</h3>

<h4>Requirements*:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Resize tabs into fixed layouts based on avaialble screen size</li>
<li>Current tab and tabs to the right will be considered in the resize</li>
<li>Custom layouts can be created, and existing layouts can be removed.</li>
<li>Layouts can be reset to default layouts</li>
<li>Ability to undo the previous resize</li>
<li>User preference of layouts should be saved</li>
<li>Single tab ability to only resize the current window</li>
</ol>


<h4>Design*:</h4>

<p><img src="../images/oldtabresize.png" title="Tab Resize 1.0 version from late 2012" ></p>

<p>Personally, I think choosing on the visual design itself took much longer than the actual app development. Visually I wanted a large action area where the user could easily choose the layout they wanted and easily discover the features (created, removing, and reseting layouts).  The most frequently used layout should be the easiest to get to - in this case right aligned and closest to the extension icon. Each of the features should be easy to get to. The options can be changed directly in the popup menu - not hidden in another view like an options page.</p>

<p>*The above design and requirements are from the first version that was deployed.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><br>


<h3>Motivation:</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted the ability to see all the search results in a text search rather than just seeing them highlighted and scattered accross the page and out of view. This was the start of the idea and it soon became mashed up with all the great Firefox quick find features that Chrome is missing.</p>

<br>


<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>A next gen text search tool for your Chrome web page. Start a search and simply press enter/return on a highlighted link and you&#8217;ll instantly navigate to that page. A mashup of Firefox quick find features (case match, links only search, highlight all, search selected text) as well as awesome new ones (scroll/navigate through all search results with context) - brought to Chrome.</p>

<br>


<h3>Demo:</h3>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x2PEyTyJ6iM?" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>




<br>


<h3>Shortcut keys:</h3>

<h4>Getting started:</h4>

<p><kbd class="light">/</kbd>&nbsp; or  &nbsp;<kbd class="light">ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="light">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="light">f</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: forward slash or ctrl+shift+f will open Quick Find menu</p>

<p><kbd class="light">'</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: single quote key will open Quick Find menu in links mode (only links are searched)</p>

<p><kbd class="light">esc</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: escape key will close Quick Find menu</p>

<br>


<h4>Menu navigation:</h4>

<p><kbd class="light">&#8593;</kbd>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<kbd class="light">&#8595;</kbd>
&nbsp;&nbsp;: navigate results by using up or down arrow keys</p>

<p><kbd class="light">enter</kbd>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<kbd class="light">return</kbd> : pressing enter on highlighted menu with link will navigate to the link</p>

<br>


<h4>Search Options:</h4>

<p><kbd class="light">alt</kbd> + <kbd class="light">a</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle highlight all results mode</p>

<p><kbd class="light">alt</kbd> + <kbd class="light">c</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle match case mode</p>

<p><kbd class="light">alt</kbd> + <kbd class="light">l</kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;: toggle links mode</p>

<br>


<h4>Tips:</h4>

<p>Quick Find search box is prepopulated with any selected/highlighted text prior to opening the search menu.</p>

<p>Toggle occurs only when cursor focus is on the Quick Find menu.</p>

<br>


<h3>Installation <small> - click icon to install</small> :</h3>

<div class="install-wrapper">
    <img src="../images/quickFind/icon128.png" onclick="chrome.webstore.install('https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dejblhmebonldngnmeidliaifgiagcjj')" id="install-button-quick-find" class="install-button"></img>
    <h4 id="installed-message-quick-find" class="installed-message" style="display: none;">Already Installed. =)</h4>
</div>


<script>
$('head').append('<link rel="chrome-webstore-item" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dejblhmebonldngnmeidliaifgiagcjj">');
if (chrome.app.isInstalled) {
  $('#install-button-quick-find').hide();
  $('#installed-message-quick-find').show();
}
</script>


<p><strong>Chrome Web Store:</strong> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-find-next-gen-text/dejblhmebonldngnmeidliaifgiagcjj" target="_blank">Quick Find - next gen text search</a></p>

<br>


<h3>Limitations:</h3>

<p>Extension only works on sites that allow content scripts. The chrome webstore page itself for example doesn&#8217;t even allow content scripts to be run.</p>

<p>Quick find does not search through iframes, script, or code html elements.</p>

<p>When results show up in same html element, will be shown only as one result.</p>

<p>Other website shortcuts or extensions may conflict with these shortcuts. A future enhancement can be to select your own shortcuts to open the menu.</p>

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

<p>Anonymous page view tracking is used to improve the extension and user experience. You can opt out in the options menu.</p>
